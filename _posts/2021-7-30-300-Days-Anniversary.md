title: The 300 Days Anniversary.
---

Hi! As time goes by, we have been dating for 300 days since 2nd October, 2020. You paint this picture for us. That might be the most beautiful paint I have ever seen. Just like several years later, we have got married, we come to the suburbs in the sunny day, recall our beautiful little bit in the bird language flower. Hahhh....extremely beautiful, isn't it?

Actually we have met plenty of problems in the past 300 days but fortunatly we got over almost all of them. Sometimes I was a bit(may not just a bit) sleeper feeling, but if I could know what I have to do or what I could do, I will try my best. Thanks for your tolerance.  
I am not good at writing love letter in English. So I want to end this post letter with a piece of poetry(Modified a little by myself).  

# Love  
(Original authored by Roy Croft)  
I love you,  
not for what you are,  
but for who you are. 
&nbsp;  
When I am with you,  
I love you.  
Not only for what you have made of yourself,  
but for what you are making of me.  
&nbsp;  
I love you,  
for the part of me  
was birth for you.  
&nbsp;  
I love you  
For putting your hand into my heaped-up heart  
And passing over.  
For drawing out into the light  
All the beautiful belongings that no one else had looked  
quite far enough to find.
&nbsp;  
I love you because you  
are helping me to make  
of the lunber of my life  
Not a tavern, but a temple.  
&nbsp;  
Out of the works of my every day  
Not a reproach, but a song.  
&nbsp;  
I love you,  
Because of your existence,  
more than any creed  
could have done  
To make me good.  
And more than any fate  
could have done  
to make me happy.  
&nbsp;  
You have done it.  
Without a touch,  
Without a word,  
Without a sign.  
&nbsp;  
You have done it.  
By being yourself.  
Perhaps that is what  
being a love means.  
(End)  
&nbsp;  
I will do my best to be your better boyfriend(Husband in the future) .  
Always look at the future, always full of hope, always full of gentleï¼Œ  
Because I have you by my side.  
That is enough for me.  
Finally, happy 300 days anniversary.  
I love you.
